# Learn Japanes Clock Coding Rules

## General Principles

- Use functional, declarative programming (no classes)
- Use arrow functions
- Omit semicolons
- Never use logging
- Never use Enums in TypeScript (use const objects or union types instead)
- Never use comments
- For method names use verbs to describe their action
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isConnected`, `hasError`)
- Never use Barrel Files
- Avoid Abbreviations
- Avoid using "From" in method names

## Keep Methods Small and at a Single Abstraction Level

Methods must be small, focused, and operate at one consistent level of abstraction. A method should either describe what happens (high-level intention) or how it happens (low-level details). Small, well-focused methods are easier to understand, test, and maintain.

## Lokalitätsprinzip – Invoke Methods Where They Are Needed

Methods should be called close to where their results are used. Avoid scattering method calls far from their context or orchestrating logic from distant parts of the code.

### Guidelines:

- Call helper methods right before or where their result is needed.
- Avoid precomputing values at the top of a function if they are only used much later.
- Keep dependent operations grouped together; the reader should not need to scroll or search to understand the logic flow.


## Avoid Using Regex

Regular expressions are hard to read and understand for humans. Always prefer String methods over regex when possible. String methods like `split()`, `replace()`, `replaceAll()`, `includes()`, `startsWith()`, `endsWith()`, and `filter()` are more readable and maintainable.

### Guidelines:

- Prefer String methods for common string operations
- Use `replaceAll()` for simple replacements
- Use `includes()`, `startsWith()`, `endsWith()` for pattern matching
- Only use regex when String methods are insufficient

### Example: Removing All Whitespace

```typescript
const removeWhitespace= (text: string): string => {
  return text.replaceAll(' ', '').replaceAll('\t', '').replaceAll('\n', '')
}
```

Instead of using regex like `text.replace(/\s+/g, '')`, the String methods approach is more explicit and easier to understand.
